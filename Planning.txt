Gun Game that uses recoil to keep gun in sky.

1. Create Gun shape with seperate parts so they can move seperately.
2. Create function that moves parts in an animation on mouseclick, and back to start point:
  "if mouseclick move (part) (amount) then back to 0" or something
3. Add gravity, and modify gravity if shooting.
4. Movement on X axis should be manipulated based on the angle of the gun when gun is shot.
5. To win the game you have to slam into a target with all the momentum you can gain. If you are too slow, or go out of bounds you fail.
